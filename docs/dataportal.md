# Building Data Portals

![Building Data Portals](/img/dataportal/dataportal.png)

## New Data Portal

You can create new data portals from an empty template or from existing content, detailed below. Data portals consist of a [Header](#header), [Tiles](#tiles), and [Footer](#footer) that can be modified to fit your design goals.

> **Note**: the *Consumer* role does not have access to create data portals, and thus will not see the *New Data Portal* button. Check your role from [My Account](portal.md#user).

### New Portal from Empty Template

To create a new data portal from scratch, click on the *![New](/img/portal/new.png)* button in the portal and select *New Data Portal*. This opens an empty data portal from a template that allows you to configure your data portal as desired.

### New Portal from Existing Content

To create a new data portal based on existing FlexIt content, navigate to the folder that contains the content and click the *Create Portal* button at the top, as shown below.

This will create a new data portal with tiles for each of the content items, as shown below.

## Portal Menu

Click on the *ellipsis* in the top-right of the data portal to access the portal configuration menu. From the menu, you can *Save*, *Share*, mark as a *Favorite*, return to the FlexIt application, and *Toggle Preview* to see what it looks like to consumers. You can also access the Portal Settings.

### Settings

Portal settings allow you to hide the header, footer, or search bar. You can also set the *URL Slug* that will appear as a permanent URL that can be shared. You can also control header and footer content, as well as the Data Portal name and description.

### Background Image

You can configure any background image you like by clicking on the camera icon in the top-left of the portal and setting the URL to the desired image.

### Title and Subtitle

You can change the portal title and subtitle by clicking on them and entering the desired text.

## Tiles

Tiles can link to external content as well as FlexIt reports, dashboards, data portals, and folders. They can also be designed with icons, background colors, images, or HTML/Rich Text.

The search input allows users to search content in any of the tiles, as well as any content in folders that are underneath any of the tiles.

### Edit Tile

Hover over the tile, click the ellipsis, and select *Edit*. Choose an *Icon Tile* for the standard icon with title and description, or a *Rich Text Tile* to design it however you would like. Use the design options to change formatting and appearance. At the bottom, link to the desired content.

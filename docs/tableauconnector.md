## Overview

The FlexIt connector for Tableau allows you to use Tableau to access any data through the FlexIt platform. This means that your organization can re-use FlexIt’s security, metadata, and other enterprise features with Tableau, rather than re-creating this in Tableau. Rather than downloading data to Excel/CSV, users can directly plug into FlexIt from Tableau, saving them time as well as making administration much easier. Follow the instructions below to get started.

> You’ll need to have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed on your computer, as well as FlexIt Analytics installed either on your computer or on a server

## Instructions

1.  Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public (free) on your computer. If you don’t have Tableau, you can easily download and install it from their website.
2.  Click “Web Data Connector” on the left, as shown below:

4.  Sign in to FlexIt using your FlexIt Authentication details (note: this is different from your Tableau login, if you have one)
5.  Now you can use existing FlexIt content or create a New Analysis for preparing data to load into Tableau. The screenshot below shows an existing report:

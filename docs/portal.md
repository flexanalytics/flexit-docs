# FlexIt Portal User Guide

The portal is a single page that contains everything you'll need to access in FlexIt. The top *Header* and left *Sidebar* will always be displayed. The main *Content* pane will show reports, dashboards, lists of recent/favorite items, and all other items that you'll work on in FlexIt.

## Header

From left to right, the FlexIt header has the following sections.

**Welcome (FLEXIT logo)**

Click this any time to bring you back to the initial Welcome screen.

**Home**

Click the home icon to bring you back to the last place you left off, perhaps viewing a list of reports in a specific folder.

**Tabs**

You can have as many reports or dashboards as you'd like all open at the same time. They will show up as clickable tabs that you can toggle between. As you tab between items, the URL in your browser is updated to reflect the unique URL for that report. You can use that direct URL to open a report directly, or share it with others.

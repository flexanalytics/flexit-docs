# dbt Integration with FlexIt

FlexIt integrates with **dbt Cloud** or **dbt CLI** to enable 100% metadata-less BI with the best of dbt

* Data Lineage
* Exposures (Dashboard dependencies)
* Joins (Entity Relationships)
* Metrics
* Data freshness
* Data dictionary (Docs)
* Statistics
* Custom `meta` for formatting, synonyms, business names, joins, time grain and more

## Example dbt Project

The [dbt-business-intelligence](https://github.com/flexanalytics/dbt-business-intelligence) github repo provides a great dbt project to highlight BI integration.

## Getting Started

## Connect to your data warehouse

:::caution Required

You need to [create a data source connection](administration.md#data-sources) in FlexIt that will connect to the dbt project databases. dbt holds metadata, but that does not include database connection details.

:::


## Connecting to dbt

If using **dbt Cloud**, you need to enter a Service Token into the dbt integration under *Administration > Configuration > Integrations*, detailed in the [Administration Guide](administration.md#integrations).

If using **dbt CLI**, you can connect to a Docs server or manually upload `manifest.json` files found in the */target* directory of your dbt project.

From the FlexIt Administration panel, select **Data Models** on the left and then click *Create from dbt* on the top-right, then select the type of connection to dbt. Read more about data models in the [Data Modeling guide](datamodeling.md).

![Create from dbt](/img/dbt/create_from_dbt.png)

### dbt Cloud

With a Cloud API service token configured, simply select **Account**, **Project**, **Job** and configure the following settings:

* **Real-time Connection** - enable this to have a live connection to dbt Cloud. If you update a model and run the job, then changes will automatically persist to this FlexIt data model. If real-time connection is disabled, then the FlexIt data model is initially built (seeded) from the dbt metadata, but then you can change the metadata locally in FlexIt. However, this may lead dbt and FlexIt to be out of sync.

* **Only show documented** - enable this to only show models and model columns that are documented in `YAML` files.

![Cloud Metadata](/img/dbt/meta_cloud.png)

### Docs Server

Enter the base URL for the docs server and FlexIt will automatically source manifest.json, catalog.json, and other artifacts from the docs server. Then, configure the following settings:

* **Real-time Connection** - enable this to have a live connection to dbt Cloud. If you update a model and run the job, then changes will automatically persist to this FlexIt data model. If real-time connection is disabled, then the FlexIt data model is initially built (seeded) from the dbt metadata, but then you can change the metadata locally in FlexIt. However, this may lead dbt and FlexIt to be out of sync.

* **Only show documented** - enable this to only show models and model columns that are documented in `YAML` files.

![Docs Server](/img/dbt/meta_server.png)

### Upload Manifest

Manually upload the `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files from your dbt project `target` folder. Then, configure the following settings:

* **Only show documented** - enable this to only show models and model columns that are documented in `YAML` files.

![Upload Manifest](/img/dbt/meta_upload.png)

## Metadata

Once you've connected to a dbt project, you'll be in the FlexIt editor with all the dbt metadata automatically populated. If you selected **Real-time Connection** for your dbt config, then you cannot make changes in the editor (see more about this in [Connecting to dbt](#dbt-cloud)). Explore your metadata model and *Save* when you are ready to create analyses. After saving, you can [give access](datamodeling.md#3-secure-the-data-model) to the metadata model to specific [users, groups, and roles](administration.md#groups--roles).

> The screenshot below of the metadata editor has orange arrows pointing to dbt-specific features.

![Metadata](/img/dbt/meta_editor.png)

## Reports and Dashboards

Once you've saved your Metadata, you can create new reports and dashboards, or load samples.

### Create New

To create a new analysis from your dbt metadata, click on **New** in the top-left and select **New Analysis**. Select the data model that you created in [Metadata](#metadata) above, and then you'll see a blank report ready to drag-and-drop fields from the right.

![New](/img/dbt/new_analysis.png)

### Samples

If you used the [Example dbt Project](#example-dbt-project) from above, then you can load pre-built samples from FlexIt:

1. Navigate to "Administration > Configuration > Backup and Restore"

2. Right-click and "Restore" the *samples_sales.zip* item
    ![Restore Sales](/img/dbt/restore_sales.png)

3. Check the "Samples (Sales)" content to restore, deploy content to "Shared Content", select the data model that you created in [Metadata](#metadata) above, and click *Restore*
    ![Restore Content](/img/dbt/restore_content.png)

4. Navigate to the "Shared Content > Samples (Sales)" folder and take a look at the reports and dashboards

## Concepts and Standards

Now that you've tried everything out with the sample project and reports, let's dive into the concepts

### Data Lineage

FlexIt leverages the lineage feature of dbt to show both upstream model dependencies, as well as downstream dashboards and reports. In addition to lineage paths, it shows model, source, and seed refresh times and tooltip descriptions. For downstream exposures, it notifies users if the documented exposures are out of sync with the actual exposures.

![Lineage](/img/dbt/lineage.png)

### Exposures

#### Model exposures

FlexIt tracks report and dashboard exposures in real-time to show you status

1. **OK** - exposure is in both FlexIt and dbt
2. **Broken** - exposure is documented in dbt but does not exist in FlexIt
3. **Info** - exposure is in an external tool, not FlexIt
4. **Needs Doc** - FlexIt report is not documented as an exposure in dbt

![Exposure Status](/img/dbt/exposure_status.png)

#### Column-level exposures

FlexIt also shows column-level exposures for FlexIt reports and dashboards. The screenshot below shows reports with their dependent columns, as well as if there are any issues such as broken links (e.g. a model column does not exist).

![Exposure Column](/img/dbt/exposure_column.png)


### Joins (Entity Relationships)

Create relationships (joins) between models one of two ways in the dbt `schema.yml` model definition:
1. Using the `tests.relationships` property on dbt model columns, which also checks integrity
2. Using the `meta.joins` property in the dbt model

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    meta:
      joins:
        - to: dim_customer
          type: inner #inner, left, right, full; default 'inner'
          join_on:
            - from_field: customer_key
              exp: '=' #optional; default '='; '=','<>'
              to_field: customer_key
    columns:
      - name: customer_key
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships: #JOINS the dbt integrity way
              to: ref('dim_customer')
              field: customer_key
```

Relationships defined in the model `YAML` will appear in FlexIt as shown below

![Joins](/img/dbt/joins.png)

### Metrics

Metrics (aka measures or facts) are numeric values summarized by dimensions. Metrics can be defined in the dbt `schema.yml` using the dbt `metrics` tag or model columns `meta` tag.

#### dbt `metrics` tag

Use the dbt `metrics` tag as defined in the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics), like this:

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
metrics:
  - name: quantity
    label: Quantity
    model: ref('fact_sales')
    description: "Sum of quantity sold"
    type: sum
    sql: quantity
    timestamp: date_day
    time_grains: [day, week, month, year]
```

> The dbt `metrics` tag approach is preferred since it is a dbt standard definition

#### dbt `meta` tag

You can also use the custom dbt `meta` tag, shown below.

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    columns:
      - name: quantity
        meta:
          metrics:
            quantity_total:         # identifier for the metric
              type: sum             # sum, average, count, count_distinct, min, max
              label: Total Quantity # display label
            quantity_average:
              type: average
```

### Data freshness

In reports or dashboards, users can be aware of data freshness for models and sources throughout the full lineage. The screenshot below shows a source with a status of *pass* and timestamp, as well as the model run status of *success* and timestamp. If source freshness fails, or models in a run do not succeed, users will be notified of the status.

![Freshness](/img/dbt/freshness.png)

### Data dictionary (Docs)

All dbt descriptions in models, columns, metrics, sources, seeds, and more are displayed in FlexIt tooltips. Use markdown in descriptions or [Docs Blocks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#using-docs-blocks) to enable rich html tooltips in FlexIt.


```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    description: "{{ doc('fact_sales') }}"
    columns:
      - name: sales
        description: "Sum of total sales revenue"
```

```markdown title="models/schema.md"
{% docs fact_sales %}

| Metric         | Definition                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| quantity       | Sum of quantity sold                             |
| price          | Average price for an ordered product             |
| sales          | Sum of total sales revenue                       |
| target         | Sum of target sales revenue                      |


{% enddocs %}
```

The model `description` that references the docs block markdown will enable the following tooltip in FlexIt:

![dbt Docs](/img/dbt/docs.png)

### Statistics

Information such as `Number of rows` or `Size` of a table/model can be very informative and build trust in the data. If the underlying data source supports these statistics, then FlexIt makes them available by right-clicking on any model in an analysis.

![Table statistics](/img/dbt/stats.png)

### Custom `meta`

Many dbt features inherently support the needs of business intelligence, for example:

1. `relationships` test for integrity also enable joins
2. Metrics define facts for aggregation
3. Descriptions and docs blocks support data literacy through explanatory tooltips
4. Lineage enables data literacy and trust
5. Exposures keep everything in working order and enable trust
6. Freshness enables trust in letting the users know when there are issues with the underlying data

However, there are many features that are specific to business intelligence, and thus not inherently supported through standard dbt features. This is where the `meta` tag comes in, allowing us to define custom attributes for models, columns, metrics, and more.

#### Formatting

Define column formatting for numbers, dates, currency, and text

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: monthly_sales
    columns:
      - name: revenue
        meta:
          format:
            type: number
            decimalPlaces: 2
            prefix: "$"
            displayUnits: auto # auto, thousands, millions, billions, trillions
      - name: quantity
        meta:
          format:
            type: number
            suffix: " units sold"
      - name: date_day
        meta:
          format:
            type: date
            pattern: 'MMM D, YYYY'
      - name: mrr_change
        meta:
          format:
            type: percent
            divideBy100: true
      - name: descr
        meta:
          format:
            type: text
            showNullAs: 'No Value Entered'

```

Depending on type, possible attributes are:
* decimalPlaces
* prefix
* suffix
* displayUnits
* showNullAs
* pattern (*date only*)
* divideBy100 (*percent only*)

#### Synonyms (Aliases)

Use meta `synonyms` when you want to assign multiple potential names to a single column. For example, sales might be called revenue, receipts, proceeds, or other names depending on who you ask. Synonyms allow you to define multiple aliases for a column that can be used for both **search** and **Natural Language Query (NLQ)**

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
metrics:
  - name: sales
    label: Sales
    model: ref('fact_sales')
    description: "Sum of total sales revenue"
    type: sum
    sql: sales
    timestamp: date_day
    time_grains: [day, week, month, year]
    meta:
      synonyms: # for business searching and natural language processing
        - Revenue
        - Proceeds
        - Receipts
```

Defining synonyms in your model `schema.yml` allows them to be search and used for Natural Language Query, as shown below:

![Natural Language Query](/img/dbt/nlq.png)

#### Business (Friendly) Name

Use meta `label` on models and model columns to give them business friendly names.

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    meta:
      label: Sales Fact # friendly name
    columns:
      - name: rev
        meta:
          label: Revenue # friendly name
```

> Metrics have a `label` attribute, so do not use `meta.label` for metrics

#### Model Order

Use the `display_index` meta tag to place models and columns in a specific order

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    meta:
      label: Sales Fact
      display_index: 1 # display first
```

#### Hidden

Use the `meta.hidden` attribute on models, model columns, and metrics to hide it from being displayed to end users in the BI tool.

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: stg_dummy_table
    meta:
      hidden: true
```

#### Joins

For one-to-one inner joins where all rows have values for the joining columns, it is recommended that you use the column `relationships` tests so that you get the benefit of testing integrity and automated joins. However, when this is not possible, or you have a more complex join need, then you can use the model `meta` tag to define `joins`.

> See the [Joins (Entity Relationships)](#joins-entity-relationships) section.

Here is an example of defining joins using the `meta.joins` attribute:

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    meta:
      joins:
        - to: dim_customer
          type: inner #inner, left, right, full; default 'inner'
          join_on:
            - from_field: customer_key
              exp: '=' #optional; default '='; '=','<>'
              to_field: customer_key
```

#### Time Interval (Grain)

Use the `meta.grain` model column attribute to define default time granularity for a field. Set it to `off` to show only the original value of a field without the ability to have specific time grains.

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    columns:
      - name: prior_year_date_day
        meta:
          grain: off # time interval grain; values 'off', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'quarter', 'year'
```

When grain is not `off`, users will see the following grain options in the FlexIt metadata:

![Date grain](/img/dbt/grain.png)

> Grain only applies to *date* columns

## Hosting dbt Docs

You can host the dbt Docs that are created after running `dbt docs generate` on the FlexIt server. Copy the dbt `target` folder to the FlexIt `webcontent` folder and then access the docs with the following URL format: http://flexitserver/webcontent/target. You can rename the `target` folder anything you want, changing the url as well.

> Now you can [connect FlexIt to the dbt Docs server](#docs-server)
